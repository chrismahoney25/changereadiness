# Change Readiness Assessment

A minimal Next.js app that implements a 25-item Change Readiness Assessment with Likert (1–5) responses and a results page normalized to a 0–100 score.

## Getting Started

1. Install deps:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Update Questions

Edit `data/questions.json`. The app reads this at runtime and renders sections/questions automatically.

## Design Tokens

Tailwind config mirrors brand colors and motion from `samplecode/tailwind.config.ts`.
